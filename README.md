## Overview

FinApp is a web application made to help you manage your finances. It is an easy to use application that allows you to add your expenses, incomes, track them and a little more (check it yourself 👀).

FinApp is not available for anyone to use because it uses free tiers of some tools that I'm not able/interested to pay for. If you're interested on using it you can contact me and we can talk about it 🙂.

## Main features

- Add expenses and incomes, called _transactions_ (unique or recurring)
- See month balance and pending transactions on the dashboard
- See insights about your transactions (soon)

## Techs, libs and tools used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
